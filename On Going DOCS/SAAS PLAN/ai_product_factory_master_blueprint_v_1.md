# AI Product Factory — Master Blueprint
## Complete Execution Architecture for AI-Native SaaS Frontend Development System

Version: 1.1
Status: Implementation-Grade Master Plan
Goal: Build a production-grade AI Product Experience Operating System

This document is the source blueprint for a standalone factory system rooted outside the existing `DOC/` OS.

---

# 0. STANDALONE SYSTEM CONTEXT

This factory MUST be built as a separate system root.

Standalone root:

- `ai-product-factory/`

The existing `DOC/` OS may inform future integration, but it is NOT the build target for this system.

## CANONICAL ARTIFACT ROOTS

All generated planning, validation, preview, and runtime artifacts for this factory MUST live under the standalone root.

- Planning artifacts: `ai-product-factory/generated/runs/<timestamp>/planning/`
- Specs: `ai-product-factory/generated/runs/<timestamp>/specs/`
- Reports: `ai-product-factory/generated/runs/<timestamp>/reports/`
- Preview assets: `ai-product-factory/previews/`
- Generated runtime apps: `ai-product-factory/generated/apps/<timestamp>/<project-slug>/`
- Never emit operative factory assets into `DOC/` while the standalone system is still being built

## EXECUTION PATHS

### Full product-factory path

`LOCKED brief` -> `product-strategist` -> `software-architect` -> `design-curator` -> `ux-composer` -> `frontend-builder` -> `qa-validator` -> `system-architect`

### Frontend-factory path

`LOCKED brief` -> `product-strategist` -> `design-curator` -> `ux-composer` -> `frontend-builder` -> `qa-validator`

### Repair path

`failed check` -> `owning agent fixes the exact slice` -> `rerun the same narrow gate` -> `re-audit`

The system must never jump from a failed narrow gate into broad speculative rewrites.

## STOP CONDITIONS

The factory MUST stop and block when any of the following is true:

- `brief.lock_status != LOCKED`
- route inventory exists but per-route briefs are incomplete
- required content slots are not fully mapped into page briefs
- quality-bar targets are absent or below the required band
- mandatory UX infrastructure is missing from the planning bundle
- planner output leaves design-critical decisions unresolved for the developer
- build passes but lint, typecheck, smoke, or spec-diff fail

## ACCEPTANCE BUNDLE REQUIRED PER RUN

Every serious run must produce enough evidence to prove the system can be executed again without guesswork.

Planner-side minimum bundle:

- site inventory
- master UI architecture
- design-system narrative and token JSON
- component-system index and component briefs
- motion system
- content library and publish-ready locale JSON
- visual differentiation map
- per-page design briefs
- frontend summary JSON with route coverage and open questions

Developer-side minimum bundle:

- production app in the declared project root
- root shim only when planner requires it
- deterministic runbook files
- executable smoke and release-check scripts
- implemented critical-path tests for smoke coverage
- self-audit with cited evidence against constraints

Audit-side minimum bundle:

- deterministic audit report
- spec-diff report
- standalone system drift check when agent or contract files change

# 1. VISION

You are NOT building:

- a website generator
- a template engine
- a simple AI code generator
- another v0 clone

You ARE building:

# "AI Product Factory"

A complete intelligent system capable of:

- understanding product requirements
- planning software architecture
- selecting design languages
- composing UX experiences
- assembling sections intelligently
- generating scalable frontend systems
- orchestrating motion/interactions
- producing production-grade applications

This system combines:

- Software Architecture Intelligence
- Visual Experience Intelligence
- UX Composition Intelligence
- Builder Execution Intelligence

The system should behave like:

- Product Strategist
- Software Architect
- Creative Director
- UX Designer
- Frontend Engineer
- Motion Designer
- Design System Engineer

all combined into one orchestrated AI system.

---

# 2. CORE PRINCIPLE

NEVER allow raw uncontrolled generation.

The system should:

- curate
- orchestrate
- compose
- assemble
- validate
- enhance

instead of blindly generating.

This is the biggest architectural decision.

---

# 3. MASTER SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The platform consists of 6 major intelligence layers.

---

# LAYER 1 — ENGINEERING BRAIN

Folder:

```txt
/core-engineering
```

Purpose:

Software architecture intelligence.

Responsibilities:

- feature planning
- backend planning
- frontend planning
- integration planning
- deployment planning
- database planning
- routing structure
- API architecture

This layer DOES NOT care about visuals.

It only defines:

- what needs to exist
- how systems communicate
- technical requirements
- engineering flows

---

# LAYER 2 — VISUAL EXPERIENCE SYSTEM

Folder:

```txt
/design-system
```

Purpose:

Visual intelligence.

Responsibilities:

- themes

This layer decides:

- how products look
- how they feel
- emotional identity
- brand experience

This layer NEVER plans backend architecture.

---

# LAYER 3 — EXPERIENCE COMPOSITION ENGINE

Folder:

```txt
/orchestrator
```

Purpose:

Transforms engineering + design decisions into composable experiences.

Responsibilities:

- section selection
- UX pacing

---

# LAYER 5 — VALIDATION + QA SYSTEM

Folder:

```txt
/validators
```

Purpose:

Ensure generated systems are production safe.

Responsibilities:

- accessibility validation
- responsive validation
- performance validation
- design consistency validation
- motion validation
- layout validation
- semantic HTML validation
- bundle size validation
- dependency validation

```txt
/knowledge
```

Purpose:

Stores reusable intelligence.

Responsibilities:

- component metadata
- compatibility graphs
- visual references
- UX patterns
- style relationships
- motion patterns
- brand personalities
- industry mappings
- reusable flows

This becomes the AI memory layer.

- alignment

---

## 5. Motion Validator

Checks:

- duration consistency

---

## REQUIRED PRODUCTION TEST AND RELEASE GATE

This phase is not complete until it defines executable validation, not just validator categories.

Every frontend build produced from this factory MUST ship with a deterministic command surface:

- `lint`
- `typecheck`
- `test`
- `test:unit`
- `test:a11y`
- `e2e:smoke`
- `e2e:full`
- `build`
- `audit:frontend`
- `release:check`

`release:check` is the aggregate local production gate. It MUST fail fast on the first failing stage and MUST run, in order:

1. repository/runtime-root detection
2. dependency validation
3. lint with zero warnings tolerated
4. typecheck with zero errors tolerated
5. unit/component tests
6. accessibility smoke tests
7. Playwright smoke on desktop + mobile + reduced-motion
8. full production build
9. post-build smoke against the local preview server
10. planner-vs-output spec-diff check
11. frontend self-audit evidence generation

The smoke layer MUST contain real executable tests, not TODO-only placeholders, for the following minimum journeys:

- home route renders without console or hydration errors
- primary navigation works on desktop and mobile
- ThemeSwitcher changes theme and persists preference
- MobileBottomNav renders on mobile breakpoints and routes correctly
- AuthModal opens, switches mode, closes, and fallback auth routes resolve
- primary conversion surface is reachable in two interactions or less from home
- one content route, one conversion route, and one contact/support route all resolve with 200-equivalent app responses

The full E2E layer MUST extend beyond smoke and cover:

- route differentiation and no shared-wrapper collapse on public routes
- reduced-motion behavior
- keyboard navigation and focus visibility
- dark-theme contrast on trust-critical surfaces
- loading, error, empty, and offline states for declared dynamic surfaces

The factory must consider a build `NOT PRODUCTION READY` if code compiles but any of the above evidence is missing.

---

# PHASE 12 — VISUAL SEARCH + RETRIEVAL ENGINE

  "style": "modern"
}
```

---

# SHOULD CONTROL

- motion
- spacing
- color usage
- density
- component styling

## REQUIRED STANDALONE AGENT WIRING

This blueprint is only valid if the standalone factory root contains agent responsibilities that match the system layers.

### product-strategist

Owns product requirement analysis, feature discovery, user intent framing, and project scope decomposition.

### software-architect

Owns frontend architecture, backend architecture, data flows, integrations, routing, state strategy, and deployment decisions.

### design-curator

Owns themes, tokens, visual language, typography, spacing, hierarchy, and brand personality adaptation.

### ux-composer

Owns section selection, page composition, information density, responsive orchestration, and interaction flow.

### motion-director

Owns motion tokens, animation rules, interaction energy, reduced-motion fallbacks, and choreography consistency.

### frontend-builder

Owns implementation output, filesystem generation, component generation, route generation, theme wiring, and executable smoke coverage.

### qa-validator

Owns lint, typecheck, unit, accessibility, smoke, E2E, and production-readiness validation.

### system-architect

Owns determinism checks, spec diffing, structural drift detection, and standalone system audit evidence.

---

## DELIVERY STRATEGY FOR THIS REPOSITORY

To make this blueprint work in real tasks without recurring repair loops, implementation should follow this exact order:

1. create the standalone factory root
2. scaffold the layer folders and core contracts
3. implement planning and design-system contracts
4. add executable readiness and validation scripts
5. only then wire the system into live frontend builds or any external agent OS

Skipping this order recreates the same failure pattern: decent-looking first output followed by repeated manual fixes.

# 7. AI PROMPTING STRATEGY

---

# NEVER ALLOW FREEFORM GENERATION

Instead:

```txt
AI selects from curated systems.
```

---

# AI SHOULD

- retrieve
- rank
- compose
- validate
- adapt

---

# PROMPTING MODEL

## Step 1 — Analyze

## Step 2 — Retrieve

## Step 3 — Compose

## Step 4 — Validate

## Step 5 — Generate

## Step 6 — Optimize

---

# 8. UX PHILOSOPHY

The system should optimize for:

- clarity
- hierarchy
- premium feeling
- responsiveness
- accessibility
- conversion
- emotional engagement

---

# 9. IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL WARNINGS

---

# DO NOT

## 1. Merge DOC + Design

Keep separate forever.

---

## 2. Generate Random Components

Curated systems only.

---

## 3. Build Thousands Early

Quality over quantity.

---

## 4. Ignore Metadata

Metadata is the intelligence layer.

---

## 5. Ignore Motion

Motion defines premium UX.

---

## 6. Ignore Responsive Design

Mobile-first mandatory.

---

## 7. Ignore Accessibility

Accessibility must be foundational.

---

# 10. MVP RECOMMENDATION

Build in this order.

---

+
20 curated sections
+
Simple orchestrator
+

---

# 11. FINAL ENDGAME

The final system should work like this:

```txt
User Idea
↓
Product Intelligence
↓
Architecture Planning
↓
Visual System Selection
↓
UX Composition
↓
Motion Orchestration
↓
Code Generation
↓
Validation
↓
Deployment
```

---

# 12. FINAL REALITY

You are NOT building:

- a component library
- a no-code tool
- a template generator

You ARE building:

# "AI Product Experience Operating System"

This is fundamentally:

- AI-native
- metadata-driven
- composition-first
- design-intelligent
- architecture-aware
- production-oriented

---

# 13. MOST IMPORTANT EXECUTION PRINCIPLE

Your biggest advantage will NOT come from:

- better code generation

It will come from:

- better orchestration
- better metadata
- better curation
- better UX intelligence
- better composition
- better motion systems
- better visual retrieval

This is the true future moat.

---

# 14. FINAL EXECUTION ORDER (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)

1. Engineering Brain
2. Design Tokens
3. Primitive Components
4. Section Library
5. Metadata System
6. Orchestrator
7. Motion System
8. Validation System
9. Builder Engine
10. Visual Retrieval
11. Brand Intelligence
12. Multi-Agent Intelligence

DO NOT change this order.

This order minimizes architectural debt and prevents future rewrites.

---

# 15. FINAL SUCCESS METRIC

Success is NOT:

"AI generated a website"

Success IS:

"AI generated a premium production-grade product experience system with scalable architecture, curated UX, intelligent composition, accessibility, responsive behavior, motion orchestration, and deployable code."
