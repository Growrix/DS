# Integrations Plan — Agentic SaaS Build OS

This document is the **agency-wide integration catalog**. It is the source of truth for what the agentic system may select from when planning any project, plus the support tooling we operate alongside every site we ship.

## How to use this document

- The **planner agents** consult this catalog when picking integrations for a brief.
- The **integration_planner** uses the **role + tier matrix** to choose defaults and alternatives deterministically.
- The **devops_planner** uses the **TIER S — Support** section to pick post-launch tooling.
- The **automation surface** (handled inside `integration_planner` or a future `automation_planner`) uses **TIER A — Automation** to wire outbound webhooks and embedded integrations.
- Each integration listed here will (or should) have a corresponding `knowledge/integration-rules/<name>.yaml` with full setup steps, env vars, webhooks, constraints, and common failures.

## Design rules

1. **One default per role** — the OS picks deterministically; the human can override per project. Multiple options listed only as fallbacks.
2. **Tier the integration set to the project archetype:**
   - `basic` = minimum viable for a **marketing_site** template.
   - `standard` = adds what a **saas_app** / **ecommerce** needs.
   - `advanced` = adds operational maturity, scale, and AI/automation.
3. **Automation tier** (Zapier/n8n) sits **outside** the app boundary; it's how the app reaches third-party tools the codebase doesn't import directly.
4. **Support tier** is everything used **after launch**: helpdesk, status, feedback, monitoring beyond errors, growth tooling.
5. Adding a YAML rule is cheap; **activating** an integration in `feature-integration-map.json` is the gate that gets it included in a plan.

## TIER A — AUTOMATION LAYER (Zapier / n8n / Make)

This is **glue between the app and third-party tools the app doesn't import directly**. The pattern: emit webhooks from your app → automation platform routes them → calls services like Slack, Notion, Sheets, HubSpot, Trello, etc.

| Role | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Internal automation runner | **n8n** (self-hosted) | Owns your data, no per-task cost; OSS |
| External / consumer automation | **Zapier** | Best when end-users (your customers) wire their own integrations |
| Embedded integrations marketplace | **Paragon** OR **Pipedream Connect** OR **Nango** | When your SaaS sells "integrate with our app" as a feature |
| iPaaS for enterprise | **Workato** | Replaces Zapier at enterprise scale |
| Local low-code workflows | **Make.com** | Visual flows when n8n is overkill |

### App-side requirements (the OS must support)

- A canonical outbound webhook surface (`/api/events`) that emits typed events.
- A documented event taxonomy (e.g., `lead.created`, `subscription.canceled`, `order.paid`, `appointment.booked`).
- A signed outbound webhook (HMAC-SHA256 in a single header).
- A delivery log table mirroring what we mandate for inbound webhooks.
- Per-customer "automation tokens" if the SaaS itself exposes Zapier/n8n integrations to its users.

### Recommendation for the agency's own work

- **n8n self-hosted** as the default automation runner the agency operates for clients (cheaper, no per-task pricing, IP stays in-house).
- **Zapier** offered as a documented integration when *the client's customers* need it (SaaS templates).
- For "build a plumber website template" → n8n flows pre-wired: form submit → CRM, booking → calendar + SMS, review → Google Business reply prompt.

## TIER S — ONGOING SUPPORT TOOLING (post-launch, per-site)

This is what the agency installs on every site shipped, for *ongoing maintenance and support* — separate from what the site itself uses for end-users.

### Health & uptime
- **Better Stack Uptime** — uptime + SSL expiry + DNS expiry alerts.
- **Checkly** — synthetic browser checks (sign-in flow, checkout flow once a day).
- **UptimeRobot** as a free fallback for low-tier client sites.

### Errors + performance
- **Sentry** — share an org across all client projects with per-project rate limits.
- **Vercel Speed Insights** — Web Vitals per route; cheap and zero-config.
- **Datadog** OR **Logtail / Better Stack Logs** for clients with SLAs.

### Backups (beyond DB-managed snapshots)
- **SimpleBackups** OR **Snaplet** (Postgres) — off-site logical dumps; quarterly restore drill.
- **CMS export cron** via Inngest — Sanity → S3/R2 weekly export.

### Security ongoing
- **Snyk** OR **Socket** — npm dependency monitoring per-project.
- **Cloudflare WAF** + **Bot Management** — for high-traffic client sites.
- **GitGuardian** — secret scanning across the repo org.
- **Vanta** for any client pursuing SOC 2.

### Content + SEO maintenance
- **Ahrefs** OR **Semrush** OR **Sitebulb** — quarterly SEO audits.
- **Screaming Frog** — pre/post-launch crawl, redirect map check.
- **Google Search Console** + **Bing Webmaster** — connected from launch.
- **Google Business Profile API** — for local-services templates, monitor reviews and post updates.
- **Sanity content scheduling** — for editorial calendars.

### Operational
- **Linear** OR **Plane** — track issues across all client projects in one workspace.
- **Notion** OR **Outline** — agency-side runbooks, client onboarding docs, brand assets.
- **Slack Connect** — shared channels with each client for incident comms.
- **PagerDuty** OR **Better Stack On-call** — rotate on-call duty across the agency team.

### Customer-facing support tools (per client site)
- **Crisp** OR **Plain** OR **Intercom** — live chat widget installed for the client.
- **Cal.com** OR **TidyCal** — booking integration.
- **Help Scout** OR **HelpJuice** — knowledge base if the client wants self-serve.

### Feedback + roadmap
- **Canny** (per client) — public feedback board.
- **Featurebase** — alternative to Canny.

### Billing / finance for the agency
- **Stripe Billing** for client retainers.
- **Stripe Atlas** if new entities are needed for templates / SaaS spinouts.
- **Wise** / **Mercury** for international payments.

### "Maintenance plan" infra (recurring revenue layer)
For the "1 year free support / paid maintenance" offering:
- A central agency dashboard that aggregates per-client: uptime, errors, deps to update, perf regressions, content TODOs.
- Built on **Linear** + **Sentry org** + **Better Stack** + **n8n** stitching weekly digests.
- Could itself become a productized tool the agency sells.

## Priority order for adding YAML rules to the OS

If the OS needs to back this catalog with `integration-rules/**/*.yaml` so the planner can activate them, the priority order is:

1. **Twilio** (SMS / WhatsApp / voice) — basic for many templates.
2. **Knock** (notifications fan-out) — bridges email/SMS/in-app.
3. **Cal.com** (booking) — every service template needs it.
4. **Cloudflare Turnstile** (form spam) — basic for every site.
5. **Mapbox** OR **Google Places** (geocoding + maps) — local-services templates.
6. **n8n outbound-webhook contract** (the automation glue) — define `/api/events` + signing.
7. **Better Stack Uptime + Status** (post-launch monitoring + status page).
8. **WorkOS** (enterprise SSO when SaaS templates need it).
9. **Vercel AI SDK / Anthropic** (multi-provider rule on top of OpenAI).
10. **Documenso** (e-signatures, common in service businesses).

After these, fill in the rest of standard tier, then advanced, then support.
